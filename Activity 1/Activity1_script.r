# Activity 1
print("hello R world")

# three times three
3*3
# ten plus two 
10+2
# name my number
a <- 2446
# multiply my number by 5
5*a
# divide my number by 2
a/2
# make a vector of numbers using "c(...,..,...)"
b <- c(2446,40,10000)
# divide all numbers by 2
b/2
# multiply variables
b*a

# Question 3:
# Run 3 calculations, at least one with a vector with 4 numbers and a variable name

# ten times twelve
10*12
# 20 minus 3
20-3
# make a vector
x <- c(172,86,96)
# divide all vector numbers by 2
x/2
